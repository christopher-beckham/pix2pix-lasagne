# pix2pix-lasagne
An implementation of pix2pix (conditional GANs for image-to-image translation) in Lasagne: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004

**NOTE: this implementation has been superceded by the one in [gan-heightmaps](https://github.com/christopher-beckham/gan-heightmaps).
Of course, that implementation is project-specific, but it's currently my most up-to-date implementation of pix2pix.**
